## Why This Repository?

We created this repository to provide a streamlined and efficient version of the currency conversion API. Our goal is to make it easier for developers to integrate currency conversion functionality into their applications. We have cleaned up the directory structure for better readability and added a cron job to fetch daily exchange rates.
